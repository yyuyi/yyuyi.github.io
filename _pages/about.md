Originally from Shanghai, China, I am currently pursuing a PhD in Computational and Data Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis. As a doctoral scholar with the prestigious McDonnell International Scholars Academy, my academic journey is deeply rooted in the intersection of artificial intelligence and public health.

My research primarily focuses on leveraging cutting-edge AI technologies—including Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and advanced machine learning algorithms—to address critical challenges in public health, such as misinformation and disinformation regarding vaccinations, particularly the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. I am dedicated to developing intelligent systems, like conversational chatbots, to accurately identify, evaluate, and counteract misleading health information.

Additionally, my research interests include the responsible integration of AI in mental health services, analyzing qualitative data with generative AI models, and enhancing the reliability and interpretability of AI-driven healthcare decision-making processes. My goal is to ensure these technological innovations not only provide accurate, evidence-based responses but also remain ethical, empathetic, and culturally sensitive.

Through interdisciplinary collaboration, responsible AI implementation, and rigorous methodological advancements, I strive to harness AI's potential to fundamentally transform and improve public health outcomes globally.
